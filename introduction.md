## introduction

Good afternoon, everyone. It's my pleasure to intriduce myself. My name is Dong Bing. I am a postgraduate student from East China Normal University. My major is computer science and I will graduate next year. My research direction is evolutionary computation. I have two papers accepted by international congress during my school days. One is accepted by IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, and the other is accepted by IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence. Moreover, I have attended national key instrument project of portable lamen spectrum system from Septemper 2014 to August 2015.

I have been worked as the front-end intern at OOCL since from April this year. I have attended two projects including transportation management system and port information crawler. I am responsible for the development of two modules of TMS. For the port information crawler, I am the main developer.

I like stydying and sharing technology knowledge during my spare time. I have a self-website to display my project demos. And I have a blog that has more than 26,000 visitors.
